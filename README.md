# Portfolio_Optimisation
Utilising GA's to develop an optimal financial portfolio.
The approach taken was to take an initial selection of assets according to some criterion (e.g. a mixture of assets with varying levels of return) 
and then use a GA to optimise the weightings (relative investment) of these assets.
